<h2>Examiner&nbsp;1</h2>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="1-summary"><blockquote class="examiner">
Please summarise in 5&nbsp;minutes
the main aims, methods and results of your work
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="1-negligible"><blockquote class="examiner">
P37. You mention that you wish to find
when the self-viewing radiation is 'practically negligible'.
How do you quantify this?
</blockquote>
<p>
By 'practically negligible' I mean that
the <b>dimensionless self-viewing ratio&nbsp;<var>R</var> falls below&nbsp;1%</b>
(which is an arbitrarily chosen cutoff).
At any point on the boundary, <var>R</var>&nbsp;is the ratio between
the amount of inbound self-viewing radiation
(which boundary tracing does <em>not</em> account for)
and the amount of outbound radiation.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-diagram"><blockquote class="examiner">
P41. This is a very complicated diagram. Please interpret it.
</blockquote>
<p>
Figure&nbsp;3.22a shows the process of constructing
an asymmetric conduction–radiation domain
for a specific cosinusoidal solution.
We have the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>[Solid black curves]:
<b>traced boundaries</b>, which satisfy the radiation condition.
There are two branches of these (upper and lower).
</li>
<li>[Dotted black line]:
<b>constant-temperature</b> (heat-supplying) boundary.
</li>
<li>[Grey regions]:
<b>non-viable domain</b>, in which traced boundaries do not exist.
</li>
<li>[Grey curves]:
<b>inflection frontiers</b>,
where each branch of traced boundaries inflects.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To successfully construct a convex domain,
we need portions of traced boundary that
</p>
<ol>
<li>lie convex side of the relevant inflection frontiers,
</li>
<li>reach the constant-temperature (heat-supplying) boundary, and
</li>
<li>reach the line of symmetry&nbsp;<var>y</var> = 0
(for joining with the opposite branch).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The only traced boundaries shown in Figure&nbsp;3.22a
are those that satisfy all of these conditions.
</p>
<p>
Figure&nbsp;3.22b shows a specific example of an asymmetric
conduction–radiation domain constructed in this manner.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-regimes"><blockquote class="examiner">
P48. Explain how you differentiate between the hot/transition/ cold regimes.
</blockquote>
<p>
When something interesting happens
(e.g.&nbsp;a terminal point or curve appears or disappears)
I call it a <b>transition</b>.
The naming of regimes on either side of a transition
comes from the dimensionless group&nbsp;<var>A</var>.
Since <var>A</var>&nbsp;is inversely proportional to the temperature scale cubed,
small&nbsp;<var>A</var> is <b>hot</b>, while large&nbsp;<var>A</var> is <b>cold</b>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-novelty"><blockquote class="examiner">
Chapter&nbsp;6.
Here you claim you have introduced some novelty in the numerical work.
Please explain this. What makes it novel?
</blockquote>
<p>
The novelty lies in the observation that we may use
a <b>different contact angle</b> when boundary tracing
to the contact angle of the known wedge solution.
This observation was <em>not</em> made in my Honours thesis.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-publication"><blockquote class="examiner">
Which of your results are worthy of publication?
</blockquote>
<p>
The most worthy results are those with practical application:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Plane-source physical fin example
</li>
<li>Dip-coating with roughness/indentations
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My supervisors and I are preparing manuscripts that cover
all chapters of the thesis.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-proud"><blockquote class="examiner">
What results(s) is/are you most proud of? Why?
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <b>self-viewing radiation analysis</b> and the <b>physical example</b>
for the plane-source fin.
These turned what was originally a rather meagre chapter
into the centrepiece of the radiation section
(the narrative was changed from "alas we have no convex boundaries"
to "look we can salvage practical results").
</li>
<li>The <b>etching of grooves</b> in the dip-coating problem.
It was quite satisfying to see the numerical verification (Figure&nbsp;7.23).
</li>
<li>The <b>new interpretation</b> of the comparison observation (capillarity)
that ties in with the roughness theory.
This was very neat, in my opinion.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="1-extend"><blockquote class="examiner">
If you had funding for another 6 months of research,
what would you do to extend this study?
</blockquote>
<p>
Definitely I would further develop the ideas in Appendix&nbsp;C
(boundary tracing in the <b>complex plane</b> using <b>conformal mapping</b>).
This looks a promising area for future research.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Revisions</h3>
<ol class="top-level">
<li>To be raised at the viva:
<blockquote class="examiner">
[…] a couple of very minor typos […].
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Suggested (but not mandatory) expansion:
<blockquote class="examiner">
[…]
If I were critical I would ask that
the candidate extend both Section&nbsp;1.1 and Chapter&nbsp;9.
[…]
However I am not insistent that these modification are made;
they are certainly not a deal-breaker by any stretch.

</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
The traced boundary is only parallel to the <em>local</em> <var>T</var>-contour.
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-1-offer"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: What does the boundary tracing method offer
that isn't captured by say finite element methods
where non-uniform boundaries can be triangulated?
</blockquote>
<p>
Boundary tracing offers <b>exactness</b>.
The hypergeometric (2F1) boundaries for the plane source are <em>exact</em>
(notwithstanding self-viewing radiation).
And although we need numerical integration for the other cases,
numerically solving ODEs is an <b>elementary process</b>.
It is <b>cheaper</b> and much <b>more straightforward</b>
than solving PDEs numerically.
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-1-fluxes"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: Did you consider other types of fluxes
to allow for negative temperature in the "non-viable regions"
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-1-fluid"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: Did you consider looking at fluid-flow problems?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
For example, could you identify interesting Rankine bodies
using this technique?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Stokes flow is also a Laplace equation.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;2</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-2-orthogonal"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;11: (2.1) Can you walk me through this?
Au and av are orthogonal and n should be orthogonal to both.
How can it be written as a linear combination of these vectors?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-2-calculus"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;15: Double check calculus for (2.24) and (2.25).
It should have du/dv=du/ds/dv/ds
but it is not immediately clear this is true.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;3</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-3-differentiable"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;23: Other than self-viewing radiation, are there any other issues
with having a non-differentiable domain?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-brachistochrome"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: The boundary traces seem to represent symmetries in the physics.
A certain amount of stuff has to get out and that can be done in many ways.
In the spirit of a brachistochrome problem, did you consider shapes
which get it out efficiently (i.e. maximize/minimize arclength)?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-superposition"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;23: Self-viewing radiation. If I understand this right,
if you have a single curve (no patching) then it satisfies the problem
(mathematically solving the radiation condition).
When you patch curves together you have a superposition
that breaks the math problem?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-images"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;23: Related to previous question.
Is there a method of images type approach you can use
to extend this technique further?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-z"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;25: Why do you need to worry about the z-coordinate?
A perfectly symmetric shape should never have incident radiation
from different values of z as the normal vectors are parallel.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-point"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;35: When A=1 the radiation boundary collapses to a point.
However, Laplace's equation cannot admit point constraints,
what is happening here?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-terminal"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;38: Can you clarify why the x-axis terminal points are interesting?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-saddle"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;39: You have this saddle-node structure that emerges.
Is there something deeper about the problem this is exposing?
What is special about B=1?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-asymptotic"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;40:
There seems to be an interesting behaviour change from Case 3 to 4 (B=1).
Did you consider asymptotic expansions of B near 1
to get a better handle of this transition?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-errors"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;43: Do you have a sense of why the errors are strongest at the boundaries?
Afterall, this is precisely a method for designing boundaries
that make the solutions work.
Is the issue the incompatibility of boundary conditions at the corners?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Did you consider numerical refinement of the mesh to see
if the error scales with the correct numerical order of the method?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-3-estimates"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;43: Did you consider an example with non-convex boundaries
to demonstrate the impact of the self-radiation
and how it compares to some of your bounds and estimates?

</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;4</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-4-geometry"><blockquote class="examiner">
Page&nbsp;48: The geometry of the viable domains is interesting.
Do you have any intuition for why there is an annular non-viable domain
in the hot region?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-4-tangency"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;54: Can you explain "convex at the point of tangency" condition
when locally the curve is quadratic (and hence convex)?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
It looks like you want the slope to be shallower than the circle.
Why is that? Is the constraint on rsharp too restrictive?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-4-error"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;58: It looks like the numerical error is greatest at the inner Td circle
where the log condition is applied.
Presumably, this is more accurate if you make the inner radius smaller.
Is it more realistic to have a larger circle
or is the larger enclosed domain more realistic?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-4-shape"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;61: As you acknowledge the power loss is the same
regardless of the outer shape.
Is there any reason one shape is better than another?
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;5</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-5-transition"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;69: The difference between the two transition A values is 0.7
which is not very large. Is there any significance to this?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-5-doublet"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;74: This “tear-drop” looks a lot like an airfoil with a puncture.
General: Why not consider a doublet?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
This is a limiting bipolar scenario and may reveal
some interesting connection to the polar coordinates example.
I guess it is in the cold regime, but what about uneven source/sink?
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;6</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-6-boundary"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;101/102: You notice that you only need to solve the PDE
(not the boundary conditions) for boundary tracing
and so you can have a separate gamma for the BVP than a gamma for the BC.
Why not pick different BC all together for the BVP solve?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Are there boundary conditions
where special analytical solutions can be found?
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Are there BCS that make the computation easier to solve?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-6-gamma"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;104: You need to have gamma_dot
and a BVP for gamma such that gamma_dot&gt;gamma.
Does it not make sense to choose the smallest gamma possible then
to increase the probability that a given gamma_dot satisfies the inequality.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-6-advantage"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg.&nbsp;110: You claim that the advantage of boundary tracing for wedge flow
is a single BVP computation and N boundary solves vs N BVP solves.<br>
1) Can you comment on the difference in computation time of the two methods.
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="examiner">
2) In Figure&nbsp;6.31 you only do a subset of boundary tracing
whereas you have a nice full curve using the numerical method.
This makes the numerical method look better.
Furthermore, you have errors between the boundary tracing and numerics,
is this error worth the computational speedup?
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;7</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-7-discrepancy"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;112: You notice a discrepancy of &gt;10% in the re-entrant wedge.
Can you comment on why this might be?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-7-hybrid"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;113: You notice the corner effect is only problematic for r&lt;&lt;1.
Can you do some hybrid asymptotic numerical method
to get a more accurate numerical solution with fewer triangles?

</li>
<li id="2-7-deflection"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;118: Is there any connection between the lack of domain formation
for the re-entrant wedge and the trouble near the corner.
It is an extreme case of deflection.

</li>
<li id="2-7-smooth"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;122: Figure&nbsp;7.17 the height appears not to be smooth.
Can you comment on this?
</blockquote>
</li>

</li>
<li id="2-7-etching"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: Can you explain to me the point of the etching in Chapter&nbsp;7?
It is not clear why it is needed for the manufacturing process.
Why not just etch the true contour and dip? I think I'm missing something.

</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;8</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-8-coordinates"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;133: Can you explain what you mean by only n and grad
(not script n and script D) have physical meaning.
n and grad are agnostic to coordinate system and all you have done
is shifted to polar coordinates.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-8-newton"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;135: Why do you think the nonlinear BVP is experiencing issues
using the built-in solver.
Why does your own implementation of Newton's method do better?
Are you essentially doing an IMEX type scheme?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-8-bounded"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;135: You comment that a bounded solution is fine

</li>
</ol>
<h4>Chapter&nbsp;9</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-9-alternative"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: The advantage you are selling for boundary tracing is
it is an alternative to solving PDEs numerically.
However, you still have to solve ODEs numerically
and also the method is very restrictive as your analysis showed.
Do you think this is a method that will be used practically?
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="2-9-flow"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: Have you considered Poiseuille flow in pipes of 2D cross-section?
This is Laplace's equation and there is great interest in polygonal pipes.

General: Can you summarize your new contributions
to the field of boundary tracing?
There is a lot of reference to [39], [2].

<h4>Appendix&nbsp;C</h4>
<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-c-conformal"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: The application to conformal mapping seems interesting

seeing the immense application complex variables has for Laplace's equation.
Can you comment more on this.
