<li id="1-summary"><blockquote class="examiner">
Please summarise in 5&nbsp;minutes
the main aims, methods and results of your work
</blockquote>
</li>
<li id="1-negligible"><blockquote class="examiner">
P37. You mention that you wish to find
when the self-viewing radiation is 'practically negligible'.
How do you quantify this?
</blockquote>
<p>
By 'practically negligible' I mean that
the dimensionless self-viewing ratio&nbsp;<var>R</var> (equation&nbsp;(3.24), Page&nbsp;24)
falls below&nbsp;1% (an arbitrarily chosen cutoff).
At any point on the boundary, <var>R</var>&nbsp;is the ratio between
the amount of inbound self-viewing radiation
(which boundary tracing does <em>not</em> account for)
and the amount of outbound radiation.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-diagram"><blockquote class="examiner">
P41. This is a very complicated diagram. Please interpret it.
</blockquote>
<p>
Figure&nbsp;3.22a shows the process of constructing
an asymmetric conduction–radiation domain
for a specific cosinusoidal solution.
We have the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>[Solid black curves]:
traced boundaries, which satisfy the radiation condition.
There are two branches of these (upper and lower).
</li>
<li>[Dotted black line]:
constant-temperature (heat-supplying) boundary.
</li>
<li>[Grey regions]:
non-viable domain, in which traced boundaries do not exist.
</li>
<li>[Grey curves]:
inflection frontiers,
where each branch of traced boundaries inflects.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To successfully construct a convex domain,
we need portions of traced boundary that
</p>
<ol>
<li>lie convex side of the relevant inflection frontiers,
</li>
<li>reach the constant-temperature (heat-supplying) boundary, and
</li>
<li>reach the line of symmetry&nbsp;<var>y</var> = 0
(for joining with the opposite branch).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The only traced boundaries shown in Figure&nbsp;3.22a
are those that satisfy all of these conditions.
</p>
<p>
Figure&nbsp;3.22b shows a specific example of an asymmetric
conduction–radiation domain constructed in this manner.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-regimes"><blockquote class="examiner">
P48. Explain how you differentiate between the hot/transition/ cold regimes.
</blockquote>
<p>
When something interesting happens
(e.g.&nbsp;a terminal point or curve appears or disappears)
I call it a <i>transition</i>.
The naming of regimes on either side of a transition
comes from the dimensionless group&nbsp;<var>A</var>.
Since <var>A</var>&nbsp;is inversely proportional to the temperature scale cubed,
small&nbsp;<var>A</var> is <i>hot</i>, while large&nbsp;<var>A</var> is <i>cold</i>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-novelty"><blockquote class="examiner">
Chapter&nbsp;6.
Here you claim you have introduced some novelty in the numerical work.
Please explain this. What makes it novel?
</blockquote>
<p>
The novelty lies in the observation that we may use
a <em>different contact angle</em> when boundary tracing
to the contact angle of the known wedge solution.
This observation was <em>not</em> made in my Honours thesis.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-publication"><blockquote class="examiner">
Which of your results are worthy of publication?
</blockquote>
<p>
The most worthy results are those with practical application:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Plane-source physical fin example
</li>
<li>Dip-coating with roughness/indentations
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My supervisors and I are preparing manuscripts that cover
all chapters of the thesis.
</p>
</li>
<li id="1-proud"><blockquote class="examiner">
What results(s) is/are you most proud of? Why?
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The self-viewing radiation analysis and the physical example
for the plane-source fin.
These turned what was originally a rather meagre chapter
into the centrepiece of the radiation section
(the narrative was changed from "alas we have no convex boundaries"
to "look we can salvage practical results").
</li>
<li>The etching of grooves in the dip-coating problem.
It was quite satisfying to see the numerical verification
(Figure&nbsp;7.23, Page&nbsp;128).
</li>
<li>The new interpretation of the comparison observation (capillarity)
that ties in with the roughness theory.
This was very neat, in my opinion.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="1-extend"><blockquote class="examiner">
If you had funding for another 6 months of research,
what would you do to extend this study?
</blockquote>
<p>
Definitely I would further develop the ideas in Appendix&nbsp;C
(boundary tracing in the complex plane using conformal mapping).
This looks a promising area for future research.

<li id="2-1-offer"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: What does the boundary tracing method offer
that isn't captured by say finite element methods
where non-uniform boundaries can be triangulated?
</blockquote>
<p>
Boundary tracing offers exactness.
The hypergeometric (2F1) boundaries for the plane source are <em>exact</em>
(notwithstanding self-viewing radiation).
And although we need numerical integration for the other cases,
numerically solving ODEs is an elementary process.
It is cheaper and much more straightforward
than solving PDEs numerically.
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-1-fluxes"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: Did you consider other types of fluxes

</blockquote>
<p>
No, but an example would be a conduction–convection problem
where the object contains two internal sources:
one held above the environment temperature and the other held below it.
After scaling (which maps the environment temperature to zero),
this would be a problem with negative temperature.

<li id="2-1-fluid"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: Did you consider looking at fluid-flow problems?
For example, could you identify interesting Rankine bodies

<p>
No.
Boundary tracing requires a flux boundary condition
where the flux depends on position, solution, and slope.
As far as I am aware, Rankine body and Stokes flow problems
do not have such a flux condition.

<p>
The normal vector&nbsp;<b class="vector">n</b> in&nbsp;(2.1)

It is the normal to a curve <em>in</em> the plane;

<ol class="top-level">
<li id="2-3-differentiable"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;23: Other than self-viewing radiation, are there any other issues
with having a non-differentiable domain?
</blockquote>
<p>
Self-viewing radiation arises not from non-differentiability,
but from non-convexity (i.e.&nbsp;boundary elements facing each other).
</p>
<p>
The issue of non-differentiability arose
in a discussion with some colleagues in analysis,
who were concerned about the possibility of line-source singularities
spontaneously appearing in corners and cusps on the boundary.
Due to conservation of energy, singularities cannot appear in this manner
unless we deliberately put them there to begin with.
With singularities ruled out, the corners and cusps
(which take up zero length along the boundary) are inconsequential.
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-3-brachistochrone"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: The boundary traces seem to represent symmetries in the physics.
A certain amount of stuff has to get out and that can be done in many ways.
In the spirit of a brachistochrome problem, did you consider shapes
which get it out efficiently (i.e. maximize/minimize arclength)?
</blockquote>
<p>
No, but this would be a good way to extend the results.
In radiation transfer problems, the relevant measure is <i>fin efficiency</i>,
which is the ratio between the actual amount of heat transferred
and the amount that would be transferred
if the entire surface were at the base temperature
(or equivalently, if the fin conductivity were infinite).
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-3-superposition"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;23: Self-viewing radiation. If I understand this right,
if you have a single curve (no patching) then it satisfies the problem
(mathematically solving the radiation condition).
When you patch curves together you have a superposition
that breaks the math problem?
</blockquote>
<p>
The patching together of curves is perfectly fine.
The solution to the field equation is the known solution, <var>T</var> = <var>x</var>.
There is no superposition.
</p>
<p>
The issue of self-viewing radiation is specific to
the radiation boundary condition.
If the boundary is not convex
(i.e.&nbsp;if there are boundary elements that face each other):
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
some of the outgoing radiation travels not to infinity,
but strikes another part of the boundary,
where it might be partially or fully absorbed.
</blockquote>
<p>
The simple radiation condition <b class="vector">n</b> <b class="vector">·</b> <b class="del vector">∇</b><var>T</var> = −<var>T</var><sup>4</sup>
only describes outgoing radiation.
To account for incoming self-viewing radiation,
we need a non-local integral term, per&nbsp;(3.23) (Page&nbsp;24).
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-3-images"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;23: Related to previous question.

<li id="2-3-z"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;25: Why do you need to worry about the z-coordinate?
A perfectly symmetric shape should never have incident radiation

<p>
See Figure&nbsp;3.6.
We have elements&nbsp;d<var>A</var> and&nbsp;d<var>A</var>*, with <var>z</var> ≠ <var>z</var>*.
Their normal vectors are parallel if and only if <var>x</var> = <var>x</var>*.
Thus, there will be self-viewing radiation whenever <var>x</var> ≠ <var>x</var>*.

<li id="2-3-point"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;35: When A=1 the radiation boundary collapses to a point.
However, Laplace's equation cannot admit point constraints,

</blockquote>
<p>
The domain (the region enclosed by the radiation boundary
and the constant-temperature boundary, which both shrink to a point)
likewise shrinks to a point.
Per the original footnote:
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">

</li>
<li id="2-3-terminal"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;38: Can you clarify why the x-axis terminal points are interesting?
</blockquote>
<p>
Terminal points along the <var>x</var>-axis are interesting
because they are critical terminal points.
They provide opportunities to switch between upper and lower branches
without forming corners.
Ordinary terminal points do not work
because they give us a cusp with inconsistent boundary orientation.

</li>
<li id="2-3-saddle"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;39: You have this saddle-node structure that emerges.

<p>
The saddle–node structure of Figure&nbsp;3.20
merely reflects the birth of a pair of real roots (<var>x</var><sub class="subscript-symbol">♭</sub> and&nbsp;<var>x</var><sub class="subscript-symbol">♯</sub>)

Pg&nbsp;40:
There seems to be an interesting behaviour change from Case 3 to 4 (B=1).
Did you consider asymptotic expansions of B near 1

</blockquote>
<p>
<var>B</var> = 1 is special in that the contour&nbsp;<var>T</var> = 0 forms a corner at the origin.
This is a peculiarity of the cosinusoidal solution
(<var>T</var> = 1 − <var>B</var> cos <var>x</var> cosh <var>y</var>).
At the same time we have an isolated terminal point at the origin,
as discussed earlier (Pages&nbsp;32–34).

<p>
Computer algebra was able to give me closed-form expressions

Pg&nbsp;43: Do you have a sense of why the errors are strongest at the boundaries?
Afterall, this is precisely a method for designing boundaries
that make the solutions work.
Is the issue the incompatibility of boundary conditions at the corners?
</blockquote>
<p>
The issue is with the numerical solver (<code>NDSolve`FEM`</code>)
and how it handles corners where different boundary conditions meet.
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Did you consider numerical refinement of the mesh to see
if the error scales with the correct numerical order of the method?
</blockquote>
<p>
No, but this is a good idea.
(In doing so, one would also need to increase the precision
when numerically integrating for the traced boundaries,
because there is no point making the verification mesh-refinement
greater than that of the traced boundaries.)
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-3-estimates"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;43: Did you consider an example with non-convex boundaries
to demonstrate the impact of the self-radiation
and how it compares to some of your bounds and estimates?
</blockquote>
<p>
No. <code>NDSolve`FEM`</code> cannot handle non-local boundary conditions.
In principle though, one could do a fixed-point iteration
where the self-viewing term is pre-computed from the previous iterate.

<li id="2-4-geometry"><blockquote class="examiner">
Page&nbsp;48: The geometry of the viable domains is interesting.
Do you have any intuition for why there is an annular non-viable domain
in the hot region?
</blockquote>
<p>
This comes down to the shape of the known solution.
Physically, the non-viable domain is the region in which
the solution is not steep enough to satisfy the boundary condition.
In the hot regime (<var>A</var> &lt; <var>A</var><sub class="subscript-symbol">♮</sub>),
there is an intermediate interval in radius
where the solution (logarithmic in radius) is less steep
than the boundary flux (4th power of logarithmic in radius).
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-4-tangency"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;54: Can you explain "convex at the point of tangency" condition
when locally the curve is quadratic (and hence convex)?
</blockquote>
<p>
"Convex at the point of tangency" means that the traced boundary
(which touches the circle <var>r</var> = <var>r</var><sub class="subscript-symbol">♯</sub>)
must either coincide with the tangent line
or deflect towards the inner (smaller&nbsp;<var>r</var>) side of it.
Translating this to Figure&nbsp;4.7,
the traced boundary must stay on or to the left of the vertical line.
</p>
<p>
The first-order behaviour of the traced boundary
as given in&nbsp;(4.35) (Page&nbsp;53) is quadratic
because it is written in terms of <var>ξ</var> = <var>r</var> − <var>r</var><sub class="subscript-symbol">♯</sub>.
Note that <var>ξ</var> = 0 is the circle <var>r</var> = <var>r</var><sub class="subscript-symbol">♯</sub>, not the tangent line.
The tangent line is given by&nbsp;(4.37) (which also has <var>ξ</var>&nbsp;quadratic).
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
It looks like you want the slope to be shallower than the circle.
Why is that? Is the constraint on rsharp too restrictive?

I want the traced boundary&nbsp;(4.35)
to be shallower than the tangent line&nbsp;(4.37).
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-4-error"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;58: It looks like the numerical error is greatest at the inner Td circle
where the log condition is applied.
Presumably, this is more accurate if you make the inner radius smaller.
Is it more realistic to have a larger circle
or is the larger enclosed domain more realistic?
</blockquote>
<p>
The relative errors in Figure&nbsp;4.12 are negative.
I should probably redo the plot with absolute values.
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-4-shape"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;61: As you acknowledge the power loss is the same

In some applications we may want a specific directional distribution
of thermal radiation (Pages&nbsp;27–28).
Or we might want to model some hexagonal nuts on a bolt, for instance.

From Figure&nbsp;5.3 (Page&nbsp;68), the two transition values of <var>A</var> occur
when the quartic curve&nbsp;<var>v</var><sup>4</sup> / A
touches the exponential curves&nbsp;cosh <var>v</var> ± 1.
Because all three curves are rapidly increasing,
there is not much difference between the two values of <var>A</var>.

For the conduction–radiation problem we need non-negative temperatures.
A dipole does not have a physical interpretation in this context,

This is a limiting bipolar scenario and may reveal
some interesting connection to the polar coordinates example.
I guess it is in the cold regime, but what about uneven source/sink?
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, we could extend the work
to uneven source and sink (with finite separation).
This would introduce a second dimensionless group (the strength ratio)
because we no longer have the cancellation mentioned in the footnote
of Page&nbsp;63.
However, the curves of constant temperature would no longer be circles.

<p>
An alternative way of introducing a second parameter
that does not change the shape of the <var>T</var>-contours

<li id="2-6-boundary"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;101/102: You notice that you only need to solve the PDE
(not the boundary conditions) for boundary tracing
and so you can have a separate gamma for the BVP than a gamma for the BC.
Why not pick different BC all together for the BVP solve?
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, different boundary conditions can be used for the initial solve.
In fact, one could probably perturb the shape of the corner roundings
by perturbing the boundary condition in the initial solve.
</p>
<p>
But given that we have already computed wedge solutions
using the original contact condition,
we do not let them go to waste.
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Are there boundary conditions
where special analytical solutions can be found?
</blockquote>
<p>
The only known analytical solutions to the Laplace–Young equation
are the half-plane solution and the channel solution.
Both of these have already been studied in the boundary tracing context.
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
Are there BCS that make the computation easier to solve?
</blockquote>
<p>
Dirichlet condition on the boundary would probably be cheaper computationally
than the nonlinear contact condition.

<li id="2-6-gamma"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;104: You need to have gamma_dot
and a BVP for gamma such that gamma_dot&gt;gamma.
Does it not make sense to choose the smallest gamma possible then
to increase the probability that a given gamma_dot satisfies the inequality.
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, that does make sense.
But larger&nbsp;<var>γ</var> might lead to rounding shapes/radii
that cannot be achieved with smaller&nbsp;<var>γ</var>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="2-6-advantage"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg.&nbsp;110: You claim that the advantage of boundary tracing for wedge flow
is a single BVP computation and N boundary solves vs N BVP solves.<br>
1) Can you comment on the difference in computation time of the two methods.
</blockquote>
<p>
A single BVP computation takes between half a minute to half an hour,
depending on the parameters (<var>α</var> and&nbsp;<var>γ</var>).
Integrating an ODE for a traced boundary takes about a second
in the worst case.
</p>
<blockquote class="examiner">
2) In Figure&nbsp;6.31 you only do a subset of boundary tracing
whereas you have a nice full curve using the numerical method.
This makes the numerical method look better.
Furthermore, you have errors between the boundary tracing and numerics,
is this error worth the computational speedup?
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, the limited range is a downside (Pages&nbsp;108–109):
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
Evidently the range of rounding radii
which can be accounted for in this manner
is directly related to the spread of the corner roundings,
over which we have no control.
The main weakness of boundary tracing is that
one cannot predetermine the shape of the resulting traced boundaries,
but this is to be expected for a method where, by its very nature,
boundary shape is the unknown.
</blockquote>
<p>
As is the discrepancy (Page&nbsp;109):
</p>
<blockquote class="thesis">
The two approaches do not give exactly the same height rises
because the rounding curves produced by boundary tracing
are not perfectly circular.
</blockquote>
<p>
Given an already-computed numerical solution (sunk cost),
I would say that using boundary tracing is strictly advantageous.
There is the possibility of obtaining <em>additional</em> results cheaply;
at worst, we have what we already have.

More refinement is required, per the "further investigation".

for the Laplace–Young equation in a re-entrant wedge.

Pg&nbsp;113: You notice the corner effect is only problematic for r&lt;&lt;1.
Can you do some hybrid asymptotic numerical method
to get a more accurate numerical solution with fewer triangles?
</blockquote>
<p>
Asymptotics in a capillary wedge will only determine the corner slope.
The corner height (constant term) is determined by global considerations.
Specifically, we require a vanishing height rise at infinity.

</li>
<li id="2-7-deflection"><blockquote class="examiner">
Pg&nbsp;118: Is there any connection between the lack of domain formation
for the re-entrant wedge and the trouble near the corner.
It is an extreme case of deflection.
</blockquote>
<p>
The deflection of the traced boundaries away from the walls
is unrelated to the numerical trouble near the corner.
The deflection occurs because of sign changes in various derivatives
as we change from convex to re-entrant.

Pg&nbsp;128: What is the computational complexity of the etching
vs just solving the full problem numerically.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Etching]:
after computing a single numerical wedge solution,
we have a one-parameter family of <var>T</var>-contours for&nbsp;<var>γ</var><sub class="subscript-symbol">•</sub>
(sufficiently large to ensure clearance from the corner).
Computing the roughness profile&nbsp;(7.26) (Page&nbsp;125) costs nothing.
Determining the groove separation&nbsp;(7.28) (Page&nbsp;126) costs nothing.
Altogether, a single numerical wedge solution gives us results
for multiple etching scenarios.
</li>
<li>[Direct numerics]:
after computing a single numerical solution for a domain with grooves,
we only have results for that particular etching scenario.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="2-7-etching"><blockquote class="examiner">
General: Can you explain to me the point of the etching in Chapter&nbsp;7?
It is not clear why it is needed for the manufacturing process.
Why not just etch the true contour and dip? I think I'm missing something.
</blockquote>
<p>
If we simply round the dipped object in the shape of a contour
(grey curves in Figure&nbsp;7.23, Page&nbsp;128),
we will <em>not</em> obtain a level height-rise profile.
The theory tells us that we must either
apply roughness or modify the contact angle.
</p>
<p>
Etching small grooves is a way to achieve roughness.
However, the irregular indentations of boundary tracing
are not very practical to produce,
so we instead etch regularly-shaped grooves at a variable spacing,
chosen to achieve the requisite amount of roughness.
